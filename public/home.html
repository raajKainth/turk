      <h2>About UWindsor AMT Project</h2>
      <p>
        Inspired by Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT), the UWindsor AMT Project is a specialized platform designed exclusively for UWindsor’s Computer Science (CS) department. Our platform breaks down complex projects into smaller, manageable tasks called Human Intelligence Tasks (HITs), allowing for efficient task completion and optimized use of human resources.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>How It Works:</strong> Requestors can post various tasks that require human insight and decision-making, while workers—ranging from students to faculty—can select tasks that match their skills and interests. Once completed, tasks are reviewed for quality and accuracy, ensuring that both sides of the platform benefit from a reliable and secure process.
      </p>
      <p>
        With the UWindsor AMT Project, we aim to create a dedicated UWindsor CS edition that empowers:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Students:</strong> Gain real-world experience, enhance your resume, and develop new skills by participating in diverse projects.</li>
        <li><strong>Faculty and Staff:</strong> Efficiently manage research and departmental tasks through an intuitive and streamlined interface.</li>
        <li><strong>Requestors:</strong> Post tasks with ease, monitor progress in real time, and access a scalable pool of talent.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Our platform not only streamlines the process of task delegation and completion but also promotes collaboration and innovation within the UWindsor community. By leveraging cutting-edge technology and a user-friendly design, the UWindsor AMT Project serves as a bridge between academic excellence and practical, hands-on project management.
      </p>
      <p>
        Join us in revolutionizing the way tasks are managed and executed within the university. Whether you're a student eager to build your portfolio or a faculty member looking for an efficient workflow solution, the UWindsor AMT Project is designed with your needs in mind.
