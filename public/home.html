      <h2>About UWindsor AMT Project</h2>
      <p>Inspired by Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT), the UWindsor AMT Project is a specialized platform designed for UWindsorâ€™s Computer Science (CS) department. Amazon Mechanical Turk enables companies and researchers to break down complex projects into smaller, manageable tasks called Human Intelligence Tasks (HITs). Workers on the platform can then complete these HITs, earning compensation for their contributions, while requestors gain access to scalable human effort for data processing and research needs.</p>
      <p>With the UWindsor AMT Project, we aim to create a UWindsor CS edition specifically for students, faculty, and staff. This platform allows eligible UWindsor students to work on projects assigned by requestors within the department, developing skills and earning experience. It also provides requestors a streamlined way to post and manage tasks, enhancing research and project workflows within the university.</p>
